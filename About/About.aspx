<h3 class="question-1">
    Why Do We Need E-Votting?
</h3><br><br>
<p class="answer-1">voting is a method by which a group, such as a meeting or an electorate, convenes together for the purpose of making a collective <br>decision or expressing an opinion usually following discussions, debates or election campaigns. Democracies elect holders of high office<br> by voting. Residents of a jurisdiction represented by an elected official are called "constituents," and the constituents who choose to cast a <br>ballot for their chosen candidate are called "voters." There are different systems for collecting votes, but while many of the systems used in <br>decision-making can also be used as electoral systems, which cater to proportional representation can only be used in elections. </p><br><br>
